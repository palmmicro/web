<tr><td>Beijing Palmmicro is actually almost a software company. We have been developing and debugging voice and video over IP related software all those years. It is like a game we play, we always play the same old familiar part, only in a different way each time. Again this time, <a href="../../../ar1688/index.html">AR1688</a> software is written from the beginning blank page. It is not based on any open source or other source software, it is not even based on <a href="../../../pa1688/index.html">PA1688</a> software. Everything is completely new. When we announce AR1688 as the replacement of PA1688, we only mean that it will replace the low end market.
