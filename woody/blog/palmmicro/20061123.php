<br /><b><em>Name: The untold story of Jan, Sing and Wang - Chinese VoIP pioneers</b></em>

<br />Mr Fandrianto received his Master degree from Stanford and Bachelor degree from University of California at Berkeley.
<br /><em>Summary:</em>
<br />1. Wang and Sing received Bachelor degree from the same Taiwan National Univ
<br />2. Sing received his Master degree and Jan received his Bachelor degree both from UC Berkeley
<br />3. Wang received his Ph.D and Jan received his master degree both from Stanford

<br />7. Then Wang and Jan founded Videocore
<br />8. After ESS acquired Videocore, Wang and Jan went to work in ESS
<br />9. The three of them work unrelated after all above
<br />To understand what is so special about their achievement in VoIP, you need to read further below.
<br />8x8: Video conference chip and terminal are its major business, in 2002 it developed T2U, the first single chip VOIP terminal solution, T2U was sold to Myson in Taiwan in 2004, and today it is call Myson CS6220. 8x8 itself has involved into a VoIP service company, packet8
<br />ESS: One of the largest VCD/DVD chip supplier in the world. Komodo's ATA186, and now Sipura, Linksys and some low-end Cisco IP phones are all based on the cheap (as low as 1 USD) VCD/DVD chip from ESS.
