<h1>The Blocking History of Palmmicro.com</h1>
<p>Apr 27, 2010
<br />On last Friday, Apr 23, two months exactly after we discontinued our Chinese web site www.palmmicro.com.cn service,
our technical only web site <a href="20080326.php">Palmmicro</a>.com was blocked in mainland China again.
People in US and Hongkong (A special Chinese region where normal Chinese like me need to enter with special permit) can still visit it,
but in China users will get error information like <font color=red>The server at www.palmmicro.com is taking too long to respond</font>.
<br />Today, after 5 days of blocking, things are still the same.  I checked the current server IP address, which is 216.39.57.104.
<br />We have no plan to build another website inside China again, for Chinese users who can not access our web resources,
please write email to <a href="mailto:support@palmmicro.com">support@palmmicro.com</a> to get all information. Fortunately the email service is still working, as it always does.

<h3>Blocked IP Collection</h3>
<p>Aug 13, 2010
<br />It is the 110th day since palmmicro.com was blocked in China. I still can not visit it from Beijing.
However, I found the server had moved it to a new IP address: 216.39.62.190. 
<br />The official name of the blocking system is called GFW, the Great Fire Wall of China, this is why I am putting the images of the Great Wall of China here.

<blockquote><font color=gray>On September 14, 1987, a computer laboratory in Beijing successfully sent an email that said, "Across the Great Wall we can reach every corner of the world." The message was sent to a German university.</font></blockquote>

<h3>Independence Day</h3>
<p>July 5, 2011
<br />I have not tried to visit palmmicro.com from China for a long time because I think it is hopeless. As near as on the glorious day of July 1,
a large number of websites including my favorite <a href="http://www.priceline.com" target=_blank>priceline.com</a> were blocked in China, and set free on the next day.
<br />I am surprised to see a palmmicro registeration email from xxx@bjtu.edu.cn today because it is from a Beijing university. Then I visited palmmicro.com in Changsha successfully,
as I expected after receiving the email, palmmicro.com is set free in China now.
<br />My first guess for the unblock reason was because of Independence Day, then I thought it might be the result of a general free movement after July 1.
After I checked with <a href="http://www.who.is" target=_blank>www.who.is</a>, I found the real reason, 
Yahoo Web Hosting moved palmmicro.com to a new IP address 98.136.92.206 sometime earlier.
<br />Over the past year when palmmicro.com is blocked, I have collected 4 IP in the black list: 216.39.57.104, 216.39.62.189, 216.39.62.190 and 216.39.62.191.
I never believe IPv6 is necessary, especially in China, we can simple reuse those IP in the black list.

<h3>Blocked Again</h3>
<p>Sep 8, 2012
<br />Last Thursday I found that I can not visit palmmicro.com again in my Shenzhen office. Tools like <i>tracert</i> and <i>ping</i> showed that its IP was moved to address 67.195.61.65, which is blocked in China. 
Add a table below for more records in the future.
